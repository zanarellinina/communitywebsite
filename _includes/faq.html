                <b style="color: darkred;">How often will I get a new buddy?</b>
                <p>We match you with a new buddy 3 times a week. If you have more than 3 new buddies who you haven't chatted with or removed (you won't get matched with that buddy again) yet, then you won't get matched with a new buddy during the new cycle.</p>
                <b style="color: darkred;">How do I remove a buddy?</b>
                <p>Click on the little info circle next to your buddy's name. You'll be moved to the buddy's profile where you'll see a "remove buddy" button.</p>

                <p>Our servers get updated *every night. Once you upload your event on the Bridge, please wait 24 hours before checking to make sure it's on the Events page.</p>
